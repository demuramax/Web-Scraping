Starfish automobile executive Daniel Corban, who is on his honeymoon with his wife of two weeks, Elizabeth Corban, at a lavish secluded lake-front house in the quaint summer resort community of Skuylkill, is frustrated. First, Elizabeth has not been seen in three days, and second, Skuylkill police inspector Murray Levine, who has a down home attitude matching the slow pace of the town, doesn't seem to be doing much about trying to find her despite Daniel's insistence that he do so. Levine does not see it as a police case since by Daniel's own admission she left on her own volition after the two of them had an argument. Levine has at least vowed that members of his detachment will look out for her and her missing vehicle. Daniel's frustration increases when a woman who claims to be Elizabeth, but is not, returns in what looks to be Elizabeth's car. He is unable to convince anyone, including Levine, that she isn't Elizabeth. And anyone in Skuykill who states to have seen Elizabeth before vows that she is who they know to be her, those people including local priest, Father Kelleher. What is even more frustrating for him is that every so often, when the two of them are alone, she will imply that she is indeed not Elizabeth, and that she has some nefarious plan for him.
